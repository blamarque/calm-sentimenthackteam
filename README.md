# calm-sentimenthackteam

Our goal is to create a system that give a representation of the current mental state of a person for the CALM charity and return a list
of resources/actions based on the representation of the mental state.
This was created during the Speak out calm day.

It is currently using 2 methods to build the mental representation:

1) A language analyse as describe here: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2167702617747074

2)An API call to a 3th party.

This is far far far far away to be completed.
